> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
methodsums<-colSums(db)
round(methodsums/methodsums["Total"] *100,2)
```

87.55% for X-rays, 4.92% of EMs 

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

87.36%
```{r}
round((db$Total/methodsums["Total"])*100,2)
#typesums

```

The proteins take up 87.36% of the total structures included.

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

1828 structures

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? 

This is because the hydrogen is usually too small.

>Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?

Residue 308.

>Q6: As you have hopefully observed HIV protease is a homodimer (i.e. it is composed of two identical chains). With the aid of the graphic display and the sequence viewer extension can you identify secondary structure elements that are likely to only form in the dimer rather than the monomer?

Yes. As is shown on the pic, the unique element is the extension at chain B residue 3, also some sequence elements are helix structures involving residue 87-92.
